  We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will provide you with notice of such changes, such as by sending an email, providing a notice through our Site or updating the date at the top of these Terms. Unless we say otherwise in our notice, the amended Terms will be effective immediately, and your continued use of our Site after we provide such notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes.

You understand that Privacy Dynamics may treat Feedback as nonconfidential.


   


  ##### 7. Third-Party Content


  We may provide information about third-party products, services, activities or events, or we may allow third parties to make their content and information available on or through our Site (collectively, “Third-Party Content”).

Privacy Dynamics does not control or endorse, and makes no representations or warranties regarding, any Third-Party Content, and your access to and use of such Third-Party Content is at your own risk.


   


  ##### 8. Indemnification


  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Privacy Dynamics and our subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of our respective officers, directors, agents, partners and employees (individually and collectively, the “Privacy Dynamics Parties”) from and against any losses, liabilities, claims, demands, damages, expenses or costs (“Claims”) arising out of or related to (a) your access to or use of our Site, (b) your Feedback, (c) your violation of these Terms, (d) your violation, misappropriation or infringement of any rights of another (including intellectual property rights or privacy rights), or (e) your conduct in connection with our Site. You agree to cooperate with the Privacy Dynamics Parties in defending such Claims and pay all fees, costs and expenses associated with defending such Claims (including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees). You also agree that the Privacy Dynamics Parties will have control of the defense or settlement, at Privacy Dynamics’s sole option, of any such Claims. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between you and Privacy Dynamics or the other Privacy Dynamics Parties.


   


  ##### 9. Disclaimers


  Your use of our Site is at your sole risk. Except as otherwise provided in a writing by us, our Site and any content therein is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. In addition, Privacy Dynamics does not represent or warrant that our Site is accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free. While Privacy Dynamics attempts to make your use of our Site and any content therein safe, we cannot and do not represent or warrant that our Site or servers are free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume the entire risk as to the quality and performance of our Site.


   


  ##### 10. Limitation of Liability


  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Privacy Dynamics and the other Privacy Dynamics Parties will not be liable to you under any theory of liability—whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, warranty, or otherwise—for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive or special damages or lost profits, even if Privacy Dynamics or the other Privacy Dynamics Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages.


  The total liability of Privacy Dynamics and the other Privacy Dynamics Parties for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Site, regardless of the form of the action, is limited to $100.


  The limitations set forth in this Section 10 will not limit or exclude liability for the gross negligence, fraud or intentional misconduct of Privacy Dynamics or the other Privacy Dynamics Parties or for any other matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.


   


  ##### 11. Release


  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release Privacy Dynamics and the other Privacy Dynamics Parties from responsibility, liability, claims, demands and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties. If you are a consumer who resides in California, you hereby waive your rights under California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”


   


  ##### 12. Transfer and Processing Data


  In order for us to provide our Site, you agree that we may process, transfer and store information about you in the United States and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law.


   


  ##### 13. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration


  Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Privacy Dynamics and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration agreement. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.\

  No Representative Actions. You and Privacy Dynamics agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Site is personal to you and Privacy Dynamics and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.


  **Arbitration of Disputes.** Except for small claims disputes in which you or Privacy Dynamics seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or Privacy Dynamics seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Privacy Dynamics waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Site resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against Privacy Dynamics or relating in any way to our Site, you agree to first contact Privacy Dynamics and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to Privacy Dynamics by email at info@privacydynamics.io or by certified mail addressed to 1525 11th Ave, Suite 500, Seattle, WA 98122. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and Privacy Dynamics cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in Kings County, New York or may be conducted telephonically or via video conference for disputes alleging damages less than $1000, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS website and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.


  You and Privacy Dynamics agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 13 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.


  The arbitrator, Privacy Dynamics, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.


  You and Privacy Dynamics agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Privacy Dynamics will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Privacy Dynamics, Privacy Dynamics will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Privacy Dynamics agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Washington and the United States sitting in King County, Washington have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.


  Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Site must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Privacy Dynamics will not have the right to assert the claim.


  You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 13 by emailing us at info@privacydynamics.io. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 14.


  If any portion of this Section 13 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms, (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 13 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 13, and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 13 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 13 will be enforceable.


   


  ##### 14. Governing Law and Venue


  Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of our Site will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of Washington or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of the State of Washington and the United States, respectively, sitting in King County, Washington.


   


  ##### 15. Modifying and Terminating our Site


  We reserve the right to modify our Site or to suspend or stop providing all or portions of our Site at any time. You also have the right to stop using our Site at any time. We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access or use our Site.


   


  ##### 16. Severability


  If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.


   


  ##### 17. Miscellaneous


  These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Privacy Dynamics relating to your access to and use of our Site. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Terms, Sections 2, 3, and 5 through 17 survive any expiration or termination of these terms. The failure of Privacy Dynamics to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. You agree that communications and transactions between us may be conducted electronically. These Terms may not be transferred, assigned or delegated by you, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent, and any attempted transfer, assignment or delegation without such consent will be void and without effect. We may freely transfer, assign or delegate these Terms or our Site, in whole or in part, without your prior written consent.

  ##### 10. **Confidentiality.**


  1. *Definition*. “**Confidential Information**” means all information disclosed (whether in oral, written, or other tangible or intangible form) by one party (the “**Disclosing Party**“) to the other party (the “**Receiving Party**“) (or all information (whether in oral, written, or other tangible or intangible form) acquired by the Receiving Party), concerning or related to this Agreement or the Disclosing Party (whether before, on or after the Effective Date) that the Receiving Party knows or reasonably should know, given the facts and circumstances surrounding the disclosure of the information by the Disclosing Party (or acquisition of the information by the Receiving Party), is proprietary information of the Disclosing Party.

  2. *Obligations*. During the Term and for a period of 5 years thereafter, each party will maintain in confidence the Confidential Information of the other party and will not use such Confidential Information except to perform its obligations or exercise its rights hereunder. The Receiving Party will use the same degree of care in protecting the Confidential Information as the Receiving Party uses to protect its own confidential and proprietary information from unauthorized use or disclosure, but in no event less than reasonable care. In addition, the Receiving Party may only disclose Confidential Information to its directors, officers, employees, and/or contractors who have a need to know such Confidential Information in order to perform their duties under this Agreement, and only if such directors, officers, employees, and/or contractors are bound by confidentiality restrictions no less restrictive than the terms contained in this Section 10. Each party agrees that the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be treated as Confidential Information of both parties and will not be disclosed to any third party; provided, however, that each party may disclose the terms and conditions of this Agreement in confidence (a) to such party’s legal counsel, accountants, banks, financing sources, and their advisors, (b) in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement or rights under this Agreement, or (c) in connection with an actual or proposed equity investment, initial public offering, merger, acquisition, change in control or similar transaction.

In addition, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information that is required to be disclosed by law rule, regulation, administrative order, or by a subpoena or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction (each, a “**Court** **Order**“), but solely on the conditions that the Receiving Party: (i) to the extent legally permitted, promptly gives the Disclosing Party written notice of the Court Order within 48 hours after receiving it; and (ii) cooperates fully with the Disclosing Party before disclosure to provide the Disclosing Party with the opportunity to interpose any objections it may have to the disclosure of the information required by the Court Order and seek a protective order or other appropriate relief.

This Agreement will be binding upon and enforceable against any successor or permitted assignee.

  11. *Amendments and Waivers*. No modification, addition or deletion, or waiver of any rights under this Agreement will be binding on a party unless clearly understood by the parties to be a modification or waiver and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party.

All rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided hereunder or by law. The waiver of one breach or default or any delay in exercising any rights will not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. 

  12. *Severability*. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, (a) such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction, and (b) such provision, in such jurisdiction, will be replaced by a valid, legal and enforceable provision that best reflects the parties’ intent for such first provision.
