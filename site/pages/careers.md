  body: "We are a distributed team made up of employees all across the U.S. that
    was built to be a distributed team. We know the challenges of working
    remotely for a company that would prefer you to be in the office, and we are
    very clear that we are remote-first. We have bi-annual in-person retreats to
    foster relationships and collaboration, but we are built to exist in a
    remote world. "

  benefits:
    - title: Parental Leave
      body: "We are proud to provide up to 12 weeks of paid time off for all new
        parents. Take all the time at once, or build a hybrid plan that allows
        your family to adjust gradually as you return to work. "
    - title: Retirement Plan
      body: "We contribute 3% of every employee’s salary to a 401k plan, whether you
        choose to participate or not. "
    - title: Health Benefits
      body: "Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision benefits for employees and
        their dependents. Privacy Dynamics also covers a majority of the
        premiums. "
    - title: Flexibility
      body: >
        We trust our employees to manage the commitments and agreements they
        make to their families and colleagues. We take a holistic approach to
        management, and believe that happy, healthy, and balanced employees
        deliver heroic results. 
    - title: Growth + Wellness
      body: We believe in investing in the health and development of our team. In
        addition to coaching and mentorship opportunities, we provide up to $500
        per year to each employee to use on health & wellness, however they see
        fit.
    - title: Unlimited Vacation
      body: This isn’t the unlimited vacation = no vacation policy you’ve seen with
        other companies. While we trust employees will take the time off that
        they need, three weeks per year is the minimum amount of time we require
        you to spend fully unplugged from your work. Unlimited vacation simply
        means that you can stop budgeting your PTO and take time away when
        needed.
