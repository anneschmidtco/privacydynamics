  - tag: PRECISE
    title: K-member Microaggregation
    decsription: When anonymizing data, we use a scalpel, not a sledgehammer.
      Privacy Dynamics analyzes re-identification risk at the cell level,
      allowing for precise treatment that minimizes data distortion. Privacy
      Dynamics’ approach reduces data distortion by more than 90%, providing
      engineers with highly accurate, actionable datasets they can depend on to
      do their jobs.

    title: 160x faster than the leading competitor
    decsription: >-
      Privacy Dynamics doesn’t require a complicated setup or a time-consuming
      integration process. Just sign up and start anonymizing. 


      Our system is built using a linear algorithm so that you’re able to receive results in minutes, regardless of the size of your data set. Whether you have 10 million or 10 billion records, we can anonymize and treat your data within 3 minutes, 160x faster than the leading competitor.
